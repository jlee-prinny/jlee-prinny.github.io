# Professional Self-Assessment
This professional self-assessment summarizes my development throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and introduces the artifacts included in this ePortfolio.

## Program Overview and Professional Focus
I completed the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University focusing on numerous CS concepts and aspects. Throughout the program, I worked with a range of software development concepts including but not limited to object-oriented design, data structures and algorithms, database integration, software testing, and software security. The coursework emphasized creating maintainable systems, evaluating trade-offs in design decisions, and aligning technical solutions with real-world requirements. This ePortfolio presents selected artifacts that demonstrate my development across these areas and reflects the cumulative skills I gained throughout the program.

## Core Competencies Developed
In my time through the CS program, I developed the ability to communicate effectively in various settings (code comments, documentation, etc.), with an emphasis on how to gather and convey information effectively between stakeholders and the software development (SD) team. Thorough communication allows the SD team to fully understand and deliver the product that the stakeholders expect and the team overall to resolve any issues that arise quickly and smoothly. Thanks to my studies, I now understand how important software design is from the beginning to the end, including modularity, maintainability, and readability of code, thorough yet efficient testing, and considerations for how code or tools can change over time as the industry rapidly progresses. Nuances that seem as small as confusing comments or the absence of them can befuddle the workflow and stifle productivity and be unexpectedly costly in terms of time or money. The coursework taught me that data structures and algorithms are tools that can make a program work better but have trade-offs that must be considered for the expected scale of a project. Though some choices may be easier to understand in principle, such as an array, it may be poorly suited for larger datasets and can cause an application to slow or crash, unlike more scalable options such as a HashMap.

I also understand that databases, which can take various forms like MongoDB, SQL-based systems, spreadsheets, and CSV files, are critical to many programs yet whose functionality must also be implemented correctly. Courses such as Introduction to Structured Databases and Mobile Architecture Development enlightened me on how databases allow data to be stored, persist, and retrieved across different program runs; an application otherwise loses data without storing it in a database. Additionally, the importance of security and defensive programming was stressed in several courses, from how small typos in code can cause complete program failures and how a poor library selection can open up vulnerabilities in the program and any valuable data to attackers. Though security is a cost to consider, an unexpected program crash due to an edge case or a leak of data can be significantly more costly.
