# Professional Self-Assessment
This professional self-assessment summarizes my development throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and introduces the artifacts included in this ePortfolio.

## Program Overview and Professional Focus
I completed the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University focusing on numerous CS concepts and aspects. Throughout the program, I worked with a range of software development concepts including but not limited to object-oriented design, data structures and algorithms, database integration, software testing, and software security. The coursework emphasized creating maintainable systems, evaluating trade-offs in design decisions, and aligning technical solutions with real-world requirements. This ePortfolio presents selected artifacts that demonstrate my development across these areas and reflects the cumulative skills I gained throughout the program.

## Core Competencies Developed
In my time through the CS program, I developed the ability to communicate effectively in various settings (code comments, documentation, etc.), with an emphasis on how to gather and convey information effectively between stakeholders and the software development (SD) team. Thorough communication allows the SD team to fully understand and deliver the product that the stakeholders expect and the team overall to resolve any issues that arise quickly and smoothly. Thanks to my studies, I now understand how important software design is from the beginning to the end, including modularity, maintainability, and readability of code, thorough yet efficient testing, and considerations for how code or tools can change over time as the industry rapidly progresses. Nuances that seem as small as confusing comments or the absence of them can befuddle the workflow and stifle productivity and be unexpectedly costly in terms of time or money. The coursework taught me that data structures and algorithms are tools that can make a program work better but have trade-offs that must be considered for the expected scale of a project. Though some choices may be easier to understand in principle, such as an array, it may be poorly suited for larger datasets and can cause an application to slow or crash, unlike more scalable options such as a HashMap.

I also understand that databases, which can take various forms like MongoDB, SQL-based systems, spreadsheets, and CSV files, are critical to many programs yet whose functionality must also be implemented correctly. Courses such as Introduction to Structured Databases and Mobile Architecture Development enlightened me on how databases allow data to be stored, persist, and retrieved across different program runs; an application otherwise loses data without storing it in a database. Additionally, the importance of security and defensive programming was stressed in several courses, from how small typos in code can cause complete program failures and how a poor library selection can open up vulnerabilities in the program and any valuable data to attackers. Though security is a cost to consider, an unexpected program crash due to an edge case or a leak of data can be significantly more costly.

## Artifact Integration

##### Software Design and Engineering
This is an artifact titled "Contact Service", created for the course CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA in July 2025. The original artifact was a rudimentary Java script used solely for JUnit testing. I enhanced it into a runnable program with a user-interactable command line interface, proper integration of its originally implemented functions, and data persistence. These changes required structuring the application so that user interaction, business logic, and data management were clearly organized. I also expanded and clarified documentation for public methods to improve readability and long-term maintainability. This artifact demonstrates my ability to transform isolated components into a functional system, apply modular design principles, and produce software that is both usable and maintainable in a real-world context.

##### Data Structures and Algorithms
The "Contact Service" artifact is also used here. Originally, the artifact used an ArrayList to handle storing and manipulating Contact objects. This was acceptable for a simple, small JUnit test assignment, but it would be impractical and slower in a real-world setting for larger datasets. I enhanced it so that Contacts and their functions use a HashMap instead, which indexes and fetches objects on function call much faster. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of evaluating time complexity, selecting appropriate data structures based on expected usage patterns, and improving performance while maintaining the original functionality of the application. 

##### Databases
This is an artifact titled "Animal Shelter", created for the course CS 340 Client/Server Development in April 2025. The artifact showcases basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with a database in a Python-MongoDB setting. Its original incarnation contained several issues, including hard-coded user credentials and edge case risks such as unintentionally modifying or deleting large sets of data. Beyond improving security and defensive checks, I considered how the system would behave as the dataset grows. While the user interface limited records displayed, the backend did not enforce limits, which could lead to performance problems or crashes. The enhanced version addresses each of these issues: environment variables are used for user credential matching instead, additional checks exist for Update and Delete functions, and there is now pagination functionality with cursor limits for the Read function to optionally limit the number of records retrieved from the database, thus reducing memory overhead and improving performance as the dataset scales. This artifact demonstrates my skills in defensive programming, secure data handling, and database efficiency considerations. 

## Professional Readiness and Reflection
Completing the Computer Science program helped me develop an understanding of what is expected in professional software development environments beyond simply writing functional code. Through coursework and project work, I became more aware of the importance of communication, maintainability, scalability, and security when designing and evaluating software solutions. I also learned to consider the long-term impact of design decisions, including how systems evolve over time and how small issues can lead to larger problems if not addressed early.

While I recognize that continued learning and real-world experience are essential for growth in the field, the program provided a strong foundation for entering a professional environment. The skills demonstrated in this ePortfolio reflect my ability to analyze existing systems and recognize areas where improvements can be made. Applying appropriate solutions using established computer science principles has helped prepare me to contribute meaningfully within development teams and continue building my skills as technologies evolve.
