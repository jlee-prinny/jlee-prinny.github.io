# Software Design and Engineering Artifact
This artifact demonstrates software design and engineering principles through the enhancement of an existing project.

## Narrative
The artifact chosen for this category is an artifact titled “Contact Service”, created for the SNHU CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA course. It was first developed in July, 2025. 

I selected this artifact because it aligns with the CS 499 course outcomes of “designing, developing, and delivering professional-quality communications that are coherent and technically sound” via potential improvement of comments in the code to explain how it works, and “to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices” by improving the existing code, turning it into a functional program, and implementing Java libraries. In its original version, the Contact Service artifact was merely a simple class made for JUnit testing within the Eclipse IDE. It had the basic components to create, delete, and update Contact objects, but that was all it did; it had no menu interface, no ability to run the code, nor a data persistence system. Additionally, there were some inconsistencies in the code's structure and a lack of descriptive comments. 

In my Milestone One assignment submission, I said that I would transform it into a fully functional application, in addition to creating a simple interface that would allow a user to type in contact details and data persistence with file I/O support. I have improved on each of those areas in this enhancement: the program can now run with Java compilation, has a usable command-line interface for performing its functions, and saves data states to a separate .txt file when entries are modified. It also has more descriptive comments for implemented public functions. In this manner, I have met the course outcomes I planned to meet. No significant updates to my outcome-coverage plans were required, as the completed enhancements align closely with the goals outlined in my Milestone One submission, with the addition of more descriptive documentation via Javadoc comments further strengthening the communication outcome. The command-line interface, service-layer logic, file-based persistence, and added documentation together showcase my abilities to enhance an existing codebase, apply basic software design principles, and improve functionality.

In the process of enhancing this artifact, I primarily learned through re-engaging with the practical steps required to turn Java code into a runnable program. The original Contact Service class was designed only for unit testing, so adapting it into a standalone application required me to re-familiarize myself with compiling and running Java programs, including with multiple source files. I also gained a little more experience with incrementally testing functionality changes to ensure a program continued to compile and run correctly as new features were added. These nuances helped me learn how individual classes work together in a complete program rather than existing only in isolation for testing purposes. One challenge during this process was refresh myself on Java compilation and managing multiple source files, as the original artifact did not require the code to be executed as a complete program. I also needed to get adjusted to working with objects and object method calls in Java again.

In addition, this enhancement required me to learn how to use basic file input and output in Java to preserve application data between program runs. While the file persistence implemented is simple, it reinforced how program state can be saved and restored using standard libraries, which was not a concern in the original test-focused version of the artifact.
