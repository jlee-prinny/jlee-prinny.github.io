# Software Design and Engineering Artifact
This artifact demonstrates software design and engineering principles through the enhancement of an existing project.

## Summary
This is an artifact titled "Contact Service", created for the course CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA in July 2025. The original artifact was a rudimentary Java script used solely for JUnit testing. I enhanced it into a runnable program with a user-interactable command line interface, proper integration of its originally implemented functions, and data persistence. These changes required structuring the application so that user interaction, business logic, and data management were clearly organized. I also expanded and clarified documentation for public methods to improve readability and long-term maintainability. This artifact demonstrates my ability to transform isolated components into a functional system, apply modular design principles, and produce software that is both usable and maintainable in a real-world context.
