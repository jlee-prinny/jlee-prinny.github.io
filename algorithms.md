# Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact
This artifact demonstrates algorithm and data structure principles through the enhancement of an existing project.

## Summary

The "Contact Service" artifact used for Software Design and Engineering is also used here. Originally, the artifact used an ArrayList to handle storing and manipulating Contact objects. This was acceptable for a simple, small JUnit test assignment, but it would be impractical and slower in a real-world setting for larger datasets. I enhanced it so that Contacts and their functions use a HashMap instead, which indexes and fetches objects on function call much faster. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of evaluating time complexity, selecting appropriate data structures based on expected usage patterns, and improving performance while maintaining the original functionality of the application.
